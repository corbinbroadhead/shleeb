# Introducing Shleeb!

Shleeb is a buzzer app for at-home games such as Family Feud. To host a game, simply open the app and press "Host", choose your game settings, and start the game! To join a game, open the app and press "Join", enter your username and buzz when you wish to answer!

## Development Notes
Current Phase:
Host's ability to control the game flow:
 - Start game
 - Expire buzzers
 - Next prompt
 - End game

 Still to develop:
 - Points system
 - Buzzer communication
 - UI work
